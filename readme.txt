Enable oEmbed-based embedding for Wistia videos in your WordPress blog.

== Description ==

Wistia's embed codes are designed to work flawlessly with Wordpress by default (in fact, we use them every day in our blog).  However, some themes are designed to strip embed codes.  This plugin enables oEmbed-based embedding for Wistia videos in your WordPress blog.  oEmbed support is not turned on by default in Wistia accounts.  Please contact us at support@wistia.com to have it turned on for your account.  See http://wistia.com/doc/wordpress for more information.  Good luck!

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'wistia-wordpress-oembed-plugin.php' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I've installed the plugin and pasted a link from Wistia, but it's not getting embedded as a video.  What gives? =

Chances are that you need to have oEmbed support enabled in your Wistia account.  Please see http://wistia.com/doc/wordpress for everything you need to know about using oEmbed links from Wistia.  If you do have oEmbed support enabled, we normally recommend pasting in an oEmbed code with one blank line above and below the embed code in your post.
